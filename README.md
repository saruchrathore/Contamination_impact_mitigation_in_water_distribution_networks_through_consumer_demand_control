# Contamination_impact_mitigation_in_water_distribution_networks_through_consumer_demand_control
This repo contains the code for 'Contamination impact mitigation in water distribution networks through consumer demand control'

The code is essentially divided into two parts:
1. Running simulation tests, with different contamination source nodes
2. Presenting summary statistic results based on the saved result data from simulation tests. The results have been stored in 'Result_data'

The code is written in MATLAB and would require the CasADi toolbox (https://web.casadi.org/) to run the simulation tests.

To run both the part one needs to simply run the 'run_contamination_impact_mitigation.m' file. You will be presented with a prompt to select which part would you like to run.
